# Usage Guide

This document provides detailed instructions on how to use the *Traveling Salesman Project*, including running algorithms, generating visualizations, and analyzing performance.

## Running the Project

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

You can run the TSP algorithms directly from the command line using Cargo. The following command will execute the project in release mode:

```sh
cargo run --release
```

This will compile and run the Rust code, solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using the default algorithm specified in `main.rs`.

### Python Scripts

The project includes several Python scripts for analyzing performance, generating visualizations, and more. Below are the key scripts and how to use them:

1. **Performance Analysis:**

   To analyze the performance of the different algorithms, run:

   ```sh
   python scripts/analyze_performance.py
   ```

   This script reads performance data from a CSV file and generates visualizations comparing the execution time and total distance for each algorithm.

2. **Generate Maps:**

   To generate a map visualization of a specific route, use:

   ```sh
   python scripts/generate_map.py
   ```

   By default, this script generates a map for the genetic algorithm's route and saves it as an HTML file. You can customize the script to generate maps for other algorithms or routes.

3. **Machine Learning:**

   The project also includes a script for training and using machine learning models:

   ```sh
   python scripts/machine_learning.py
   ```

   This script loads city coordinates, builds and trains a neural network model, and saves the trained model for later use.

### Using the API

The project provides a RESTful API for solving TSP instances using different algorithms. Here's how to use the API:

1. **Start the API Server:**

   Use Cargo to start the API server:

   ```sh
   cargo run --bin tsp_api
   ```

   This command launches the server, which listens for HTTP POST requests at `http://127.0.0.1:3030/solve`.

2. **Send a POST Request:**

   You can send a POST request to the `/solve` endpoint with the following JSON body:

   ```json
   {
     "coordinates": [
       [52.5200, 13.4050],
       [48.8566, 2.3522],
       [51.5074, -0.1278],
       [40.7128, -74.0060]
     ],
     "algorithm": "genetic"
   }
   ```

   The `coordinates` array should contain latitude and longitude pairs for the cities. The `algorithm` field specifies which algorithm to use (`dp`, `nearest_neighbor`, `genetic`, `hybrid`, `ml`, or `multi_objective`).

3. **API Response:**

   The server will respond with a JSON object containing the calculated route, total distance, and execution time:

   ```json
   {
     "route": [0, 1, 2, 3, 0],
     "total_distance": 12345.67,
     "execution_time": 0.023
   }
   ```

### Visualization

You can visualize the routes generated by the algorithms using the following methods:

1. **Static Plots:**

   The project automatically generates PNG images for each route when running the main program. These images are saved in the `outputs/` directory.

2. **Interactive Maps:**

   Use the `generate_map.py` script to create interactive HTML maps that can be viewed in a web browser. These maps provide a more dynamic way to explore the routes.

## Customization

The project is designed to be flexible and extendable. Here are a few ways you can customize it:

- **Add New Algorithms:** Extend the `src/algorithms/` module with your own implementations.
- **Modify Data Handling:** Customize how data is loaded, processed, and stored by editing the `src/data_handling.rs` module.
- **Adjust Visualization:** Modify the `src/visualization.rs` module to change how routes are plotted and displayed.

## Conclusion

This guide provides the necessary steps to run and utilize the *Traveling Salesman Project*. Whether you are analyzing algorithms, visualizing routes, or integrating with the API, this project offers a robust toolkit for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem.
